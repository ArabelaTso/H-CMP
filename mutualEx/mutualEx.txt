Caching Murphi Release 5.4.9.1
Finite-state Concurrent System Verifier.

Caching Murphi Release 5.4.9.1 is based on various versions of Murphi.
Caching Murphi Release 5.4.9.1 :
Copyright (C) 2009-2012 by Sapienza University of Rome.
Murphi release 3.1 :
Copyright (C) 1992 - 1999 by the Board of Trustees of
Leland Stanford Junior University.

==========================================================================

Protocol: mutualEx/mutualEx

Algorithm:
	Verification by breadth first search.
	with symmetry algorithm 3 -- Heuristic Small Memory Normalization
	with permutation trial limit 10.

Memory usage:

	* The size of each state is 24 bits (rounded up to 8 bytes).
	* The memory allocated for the hash table and state queue is
	  10240 Mbytes.
	  With two words of overhead per state, the maximum size of
	  the state space is 609523813 states.
	   * Use option "-k" or "-m" to increase this, if necessary.
	* Capacity in queue for breadth-first search: 60952381 states.
	   * Change the constant gPercentActiveStates in mu_prolog.inc
	     to increase this, if necessary.
State 1:
n[NODE_1]:I
n[NODE_2]:I
x:true

State 2:
n[NODE_1]:I
n[NODE_2]:T
x:true

State 3:
n[NODE_1]:I
n[NODE_2]:C
x:false

State 4:
n[NODE_1]:T
n[NODE_2]:T
x:true

State 5:
n[NODE_1]:I
n[NODE_2]:E
x:false

State 6:
n[NODE_1]:T
n[NODE_2]:C
x:false

State 7:
n[NODE_1]:T
n[NODE_2]:E
x:false


==========================================================================

Status:

	No error found.

State Space Explored:

	7 states, 12 rules fired in 14.06s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
